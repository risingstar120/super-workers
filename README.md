### Features

1. Run multipe tasks parallely without blocking the main thread.
2. Jank-free pages since all the computations take place in worker-thread and not in main-thread (thereby speed and performance at the same time).
3. On-demand initialization of web-workers based on task-queue size. Configure minimum and maximum number of web-workers or let library smartly decide based on hardware concurrency number.
4. Configure task(set priority, time-to-live) and *Priority Task Queue Management System(PTQMS)* will take care of the queue handling and execution.
5. Termination of idle(non-used) web-workers for better performance(can be opt-out while configuring). Set minimum number of web-workers to restrict their termination when idle, so that they remain present for future needs.
6. Fully fledged API to get all the information regarding tasks and workers at any given point of time.
7. Promise based execution of tasks i.e. perform different actions on success or failure. Useful for re-attempting failed task.
8. Define callbacks to be get triggered at various events. Eg. on successful execution of task, on exceeding the time limit of task execution, etc.
9. Exports in a UMD format i.e. library works everywhere (nodejs doesn't have the concept of workers but have child-process concept which is not handled in this lib).
10. Only `~5.5 KB` gzipped.

### Flow Diagram

**Aim** - To be able to run multiple tasks simultaneously without freezing the web-page

- Tasks are queued as they arrive.
- Task Queue Process Management(TQPM) processes the queue and based on tasks' priority, it reorders the queue.
- Workers are spawned as and when required based on number of tasks and configuration.
- Availability of workers decide the number of tasks getting processed.
- Completion of a task allow the next queued task to be get executed.

Below diagram will aid in understanding the flow better

#### Explanation of diagram

***Setting the workers configuration***

Lets have the following worker configuration:

- minimum number of workers always available to execute tasks - `minWorkers = 1`
- maximum number of workers that should be spwaned irrespective of the number of tasks in the queue - `maxWorkers = 3`. This number will restrict registering of workers more than this number. We can not set this number randomly since it depend on the number of cores in a machine. By default, the library will pick it for you using `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` or it's polyfill. Setting it too high will not boost queue processing as it becomes constant after the threshold(totally depends upon the hardware configuration).

---

***Task Queue Process Management***

- Initially the task queue(TQ) is empty.
- Task T1, T2, and T3 arrive in the same order but with different priorities.
- Task T1 is of `medium` priority.
- T1 is pushed into queue and `Task Queue Process Management` reorders the `TQ` based on tasks' prioriies.
- After proper ordering of tasks, task is ready to be executed by the web-worker

---

***Web worker Execution***

- Firstly, availability of workers is checked.
- If there is no worker available, there are two cases.
  i) All workers are busy i.e. maxWorkers number has been reached, so, tasks need to be in queue for more time before they can be picked up for execution.
  ii) No worker has been spwaned yet and `maxNumbers` is greater than the number of spawned workers.
- If the condition for spwaning a new worker passes, a web-worker is registered and the task is removed from the TQ and is executed.
- Worker(s) execute(s) the task(s) and return a `promise`.
- After completion of task, the process is re-run to execute next pending tasks in the `TQ`.

### Usage

##### Create an instance / reference before using.

**Main Thread**

```
var sp = new SuperWorkers.MainThread({
    url: 'js/my-worker.js'
});
```

`Constructor` accepts a configurable `Object` with the following keys.

* `url`: The path of worker script
* `maxWorkers`: Maximum workers that can be spawned to execute parallel tasks. Depends on CPU cores(hardwareConcurrency) of a machine
* `minWorkers`: Minimum workers that should be always available to execute parallel tasks (one worker should alive if tasks keep coming).
* `killWorkersAfterJob`: Kills all the idle workers(no longer required as tasks are completed) except one worker.

| Config Keys               |     default    |      accepts                              |
| ---------------------     | -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **url**                   |     Undefined  |            String(url)                    |
| **maxWorkers**            |     3          |            Number                         |
| **minWorkers**            |     1          |            Number                         |
| **killWorkersAfterJob**   |     true       |            Boolean                        |

***Note***: Url of the worker script is mandatory.


**Worker Thread**

```
// Include the library
importScripts('path/to/super-workers.min.js');
// It will expose `SuperWorkers`
```

```
var child = new SuperWorkers.WorkerThread();
```

`Constructor` doesn't need any configuration but would accept a configurable `Object` with different keys that would not be used by the library.

### API

Refer [above section](#create-an-instance--reference-before-using) on how to create an instance before hitting API methods.

##### Main Thread Methods

* **`exec`**

  Executes a task

    function add (a, b, timeout) {
      var p = SuperWorkers.Promise.defer();

      setTimeout(function () {
